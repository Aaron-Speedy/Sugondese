# Sugondese

## Phonology
The phonology of Sugondese is quite simple. There are only 19 consonants with no silent letters or context-dependent pronunciation. The consonants are, m, n, p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, sh, j, ch, l, w, y, and h. All of these are exactly the same as in English, except for j, which is pronounced like the g in genre. 
There are 5 vowels. They are, a, e, i, o u. If you know Japanese or Spanish, you can pronounce these pretty easily, but for those who don't, they are pronounced, f**a**ther, b**e**t, m**ee**t, m**o**re, and f**oo**d
Every word in Sugondese is exactly one syllable. Words are CV(V...)C, meaning there is one initial consonant, one final consonant, and one or more vowels. 
## Basic Grammar
There are two basic word types. Au words, and particles. Particles are words that indicate grammar. Think of words like but, however, to, or using. Au words have standalone meanings, meaning, unlike particles, they can mean something on their own. Think of words like car, eat, or good. 
Particles always have the vowel *e*, while au words have either a or u in their base form.
#### Base words, word order, and conjugation 
Au words have base forms. This means that they can relate to the rest of the sentence however they want. To tell how they fit in with the rest of the sentence, they need to be conjugated. Subjects and objects are left unconjugated and are determined through word order. The subject goes first, then the verb, and finally the object, just like in English. Think of the sentence, *The animal eats food*. The subject is *the animal*, the verb is *eats*, and the object is *food*.  To say this in Sugondese, you would say *Vuf wid wad*.  Vuf, meaning animal, is unconjugated. You can see from the order of the sentence that it is the subject of the sentence. Wid, meaning food and to eat, is conjugated to the verb form. Wad, again, meaning food and to eat, is left unconjugated and simply means food. You can see from the order of the sentence that it is the object.

#### Conjugation
To conjugate a word in Sugondese, you find the vowel of the base form of the word and replace it with the corresponding vowel of the form you are conjugating to. For example, the base word wad means food and to eat. In order to conjugate it into the verb form, you replace a with i, resulting in wid. 
The 7 conjugation patterns in Sugondese are:
- a/u = noun
- i/o = verb
- ia/ua = adjective/adverb
- ai/au = command : verb
- oi/ei = question : verb
- eu/eo = if : verb
- ue/oe = then : verb  

You've already seen the noun and verb conjugations. We'll talk about the others later. 
Try conjugating these words
<details> 
  <summary> tal : verb </summary>
   til
</details>
<details> 
  <summary> kud : verb </summary>
   kod
</details>
<details> 
  <summary> chuf : noun </summary>
   chuf
</details>

- lut = plant, vegetation, vegetable
- gat = I, me
- vus = to accept
- wad = to eat, to drink, to consume, to swallow, to ingest, food, food-like, edible  

Using these words, translate the following sentences 
<details> 
  <summary> I eat the plant</summary>
    Gat wid lut
</details>
<details> 
  <summary> I accept the plant</summary>
    Gat vos lut
</details>
<details> 
  <summary> The plant eats me</summary>
    Lut wid gat
</details>

#### Word derivation
You might've noticed that some words don't have noun, adjective, or verb definitions. If this is the case, they can be derived using these rules.   
Adjectives: 
 - to be [modifier]
 - [modifier]-ness  

Nouns: 
 - to be [noun]
 - of/relating to [noun]  

Verbs: 
 - Generic Object of the verb(Whatever is most commonly put as the object of the verb, ie eat and food)
 - Capability ("[verb]-able")
#### Questions
There are three kinds of questions you may want to ask: polar questions (yes/no), open questions (who/what/why etc), and alternative questions (this or that). Let's go over them one by one.
To express polar questions, all you need to do is conjugate the verb to the question form. As you might remember from up there, the question form is oi/ei. 
Try turning these statements into questions. 
<details> 
  <summary>Pan pim lam</summary>
    Pan poim lam?
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>Kud shij chuk</summary>
    Kud shoij chuk?
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>Lam shol</summary>
    Lam sheil?
</details>
To express open questions, replace the word in question with lep and conjugate the verb to the question form. 
If the verb is the word in question, nothing needs to be conjugated

- hab = little, small
- vuf = animal
- vup = complex, difficult 
<details> 
  <summary>What is small?</summary>
    Lep hoib?
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>What is complex?</summary>
    Lep veip? 
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>The animal is what?</summary>
    Lam lup?
</details>

To express alternative questions, conjugate the verb and use nel.  
nag = big, large
<details> 
  <summary>Is the animal small or large?</summary>
    Lam hoib nel noig? 
</details>

#### Commands and Requests 
The ia/ua conjugation works the same way as i/o, marking the verb, except that it turns the statement into a recommendation, suggestion, or what the speaker believes should happen. When used with a subject, it marks what the speaker thinks the subject should do. When used without a subject, it acts as a command or request of the speaker. Note that this is completely neutral and does not imply negative tone.  
 - jup = to draw  
 - jut = he, she, it, him, her, they  
<details> 
  <summary>She should draw</summary>
    Jut juap
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>Juap</summary>
    Draw / I wish you would draw
</details>

#### Adjectives and Adverbs
In Sugondese, adjectives and adverbs, collectively called modifiers, can be formed by conjugating the verb to the modifer form(ia/ua) and placing it after the modified word. 
 - dash = good
 - gag = bad
 - paz = car
<details> 
  <summary>Good car</summary>
    Paz diash
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>Paz giag</summary>
    Bad car
</details>
