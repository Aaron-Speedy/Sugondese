# Sugondese

## Phonology
The phonology in Sugondese is quite simple. There are only 16 consonants with no silent letters or context-dependent pronunciation. The consonants are, m, n, p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, sh, j, ch, and l. All of these are exactly the same as in English, except for j, which is pronounced like the g in genre. 
There are 5 vowels. They are, a, e, i, o u. If you know Japanese or Spanish, you can pronounce these pretty easily, but for those who don't, they are pronounced, f**a**ther, b**e**t, m**ee**t, m**o**re, and f**oo**d
Every word in Sugondese is exactly one syllable. Words are CV(V...)C, meaning there is one initial consonant, one final consonant, and one or more vowels. 
## Basic Grammar
There are two basic word types. Au words, and particles. Particles are words that indicate grammar. Think of words like but, however, to, or using. Au words have standalone meanings, meaning, unlike particles, they can mean something on their own. Think of words like car, eat, or good. 
Particles always have the vowel *e*, while au words have either a or u in their base form.
#### Base words, word order, and conjugation 
Au words have base forms. This means that they can relate to the rest of the sentence however they want. To tell how they fit in with the rest of the sentence, they need to be conjugated. Subjects and objects are left unconjugated and are determined through word order. The subject goes first, then the verb, and finally the object, just like in English. Think of the sentence, *The animal eats food*. The subject is *the animal*, the verb is *eats*, and the object is *food*.  To say this in Sugondese, you would say *lam dim dam*.  Lam, meaning animal, is unconjugated. You can see from the order of the sentence that it is the subject of the sentence. Dim, meaning food and to eat, is conjugated to the verb form. Dam, again, meaning food and to eat, is left unconjugated and simply means food. You can see from the order of the sentence that it is the object.

#### Conjugation

For example, the base word dam means food and to eat. In order to conjugate it into the verb form, you replace a with i, resulting in dim.
