# Sugondese

## Phonology
The phonology of Sugondese is quite simple. There are only 19 consonants with no silent letters or context-dependent pronunciation. The consonants are, m, n, p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, sh, j, ch, l, bl, kl, and h. All of these are exactly the same as in English, except for j, which is pronounced like the g in genre. 
There are 5 vowels. They are, a, e, i, o u. If you know Japanese or Spanish, you can pronounce these pretty easily, but for those who don't, they are pronounced, f**a**ther, b**e**t, m**ee**t, m**o**re, and f**oo**d
Every word in Sugondese is exactly one syllable. Words are CV(V...)C, meaning there is one initial consonant, one final consonant, and one or more vowels. 
## Resolving Ambiguity 
Sugondese has a total of 273 au words. With so few words, you might expect complex communication to be essentially impossible. This is not the case. Because of Sugondese's robust derivation system, any word can act as any part of speech, and new words can be derived using adjectives. This allows for essentially infinite words. 
## Basic Grammar
There are two basic word types. Au words, and particles. Particles are words that indicate grammar. Think of words like but, however, to, or using. Au words have standalone meanings, meaning, unlike particles, they can mean something on their own. Think of words like car, eat, or good. 
Particles always have the vowel *e*, while au words have either a or u in their base form.
#### Base words, word order, and conjugation 
Au words have base forms. This means that they can relate to the rest of the sentence however they want. To tell how they fit in with the rest of the sentence, they need to be conjugated. Subjects and objects are left unconjugated and are determined through word order. The subject goes first, then the verb, and finally the object, just like in English. Think of the sentence, *The animal eats food*. The subject is *the animal*, the verb is *eats*, and the object is *food*.  To say this in Sugondese, you would say *Vuf klid *.  Vuf, meaning animal, is unconjugated. You can see from the order of the sentence that it is the subject of the sentence. klid, meaning food and to eat, is conjugated to the verb form. , again, meaning food and to eat, is left unconjugated and simply means food. You can see from the order of the sentence that it is the object.

#### Conjugation
To conjugate a word in Sugondese, you find the vowel of the base form of the word and replace it with the corresponding vowel of the form you are conjugating to. For example, the base word  means food and to eat. In order to conjugate it into the verb form, you replace a with i, resulting in klid. 
The 6 conjugation patterns in Sugondese are:
- a/u = noun
- i/o = verb
- ia/ua = adjective/adverb
- ai/au = command : verb
- oi/ei = question : verb
- eu/eo = if : verb

You've already seen the noun and verb conjugations. We'll talk about the others later. 
Try conjugating these words
<details> 
  <summary> tal : verb </summary>
   til
</details>
<details> 
  <summary> kud : verb </summary>
   kod
</details>
<details> 
  <summary> chuf : noun </summary>
   chuf
</details>

- lut = plant, vegetation, vegetable
- gat = I, me
- vus = to accept
-  = to eat, to drink, to consume, to swallow, to ingest, food, food-like, edible  

Using these words, translate the following sentences 
<details> 
  <summary> I eat the plant</summary>
    Gat klid lut
</details>
<details> 
  <summary> I accept the plant</summary>
    Gat vos lut
</details>
<details> 
  <summary> The plant eats me</summary>
    Lut klid gat
</details>

#### Word derivation
You might've noticed that some words don't have noun, adjective, or verb definitions. If this is the case, they can be derived using these rules.   
Adjectives: 
 - to be [modifier]
 - [modifier]-ness  

Nouns: 
 - to be [noun]
 - of/relating to [noun]  

Verbs: 
 - Generic Object of the verb(Whatever is most commonly put as the object of the verb, ie eat and food)
 - Capability ("[verb]-able")
#### Questions
There are three kinds of questions you may want to ask: polar questions (yes/no), open questions (who/what/why etc), and alternative questions (this or that). Let's go over them one by one.
To express polar questions, all you need to do is conjugate the verb to the question form. As you might remember from up there, the question form is oi/ei. To reply to a polar question, simply reply with nuj(yes) or gud(no). 
Try turning these statements into questions. 
<details> 
  <summary>Pan pim lam</summary>
    Pan poim lam?
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>Kud shij chuk</summary>
    Kud shoij chuk?
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>Lam shol</summary>
    Lam sheil?
</details>
To express open questions, replace the word in question with lep and conjugate the verb to the question form. 
If the verb is the word in question, nothing needs to be conjugated

- hab = little, small
- vuf = animal
- vup = complex, difficult 
<details> 
  <summary>What is small?</summary>
    Lep hoib?
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>What is complex?</summary>
    Lep veip? 
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>The animal is what?</summary>
    Lam lup?
</details>

To express alternative questions, conjugate the verb and use nel.  
nag = big, large
<details> 
  <summary>Is the animal small or large?</summary>
    Lam hoib nel noig? 
</details>

#### Commands and Requests 
The ia/ua conjugation works the same way as i/o, marking the verb, except that it turns the statement into a recommendation, suggestion, or what the speaker believes should happen. When used with a subject, it marks what the speaker thinks the subject should do. When used without a subject, it acts as a command or request of the speaker. Note that this is completely neutral and does not imply a negative tone.  
 - jup = to draw  
 - jut = he, she, it, him, her, they  
<details> 
  <summary>She should draw</summary>
    Jut juap
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>Juap</summary>
    Draw / I wish you would draw
</details>

#### Adjectives and Adverbs
In Sugondese, adjectives and adverbs, collectively called modifiers, can be formed by conjugating the verb to the modifer form(ia/ua) and placing it after the modified word. 
 - dash = good
 - gag = bad
 - paz = car
<details> 
  <summary>Good car</summary>
    Paz diash
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>Paz giag</summary>
    Bad car
</details>

#### Conditional statements
In Sugondese, conditional statements are statements of the form, *if...then...*. In order to express this, you conjugate the first sentence to the if form(eu/eo), and the second sentence normally. 
<details> 
  <summary>If they draw, they're good</summary>
    Jut jeop. Jut dish. 
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>Gat weud. Gat klid lud</summary>
    If I eat, I eat plants. 
</details>

#### Prepositions 
There are ten prepositions in Sugondese. 
- sem - from (ablative)  
- ses - in, at, on (locative) 
- sen - using (instrumental) 
- sel - towards, to, in order to (dative, allative) 
- sej - more then, better than
- sesh - less than, worse than
- sek - along with, with (comitative)
- set - because of, caused by (causal)
- sed - like
- sech - for, so that  

They are used exactly the same as in English. When using sesh or sej, the thing that is more/less than is an adjective, meaning it is conjugated to the modifier form. Once the property is stated, the one who has that property is said right after as a noun.  
nuz = you  
pash = earth, land, outdoors, world, country, territory, soil, ground  
such = to know, to be skilled in, to be wise about, to have information on  
<details> 
  <summary>You draw better than me</summary>
    Nuz jop sej diash gat. 
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>I draw because you draw</summary>
  Gat jop set nuz jop. 
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>Gat klid ses pash suach</summary>
  I eat in the school(literally, I eat in the knowledge place)
</details>

#### Special particles
There are some special particles that are neither prepositions nor related to each other. 
- lep - this fills in for whatever is being asked in a non-y/n question
- len - this negates the preposition before it or verb after it 
- lech - this is a context marker. sentence... lech sentence, meaning, in the context of [x], [y]
- leb - same as lech, but it acts on the end of a sentence
- lev - noun clause 
- leg - relative clause
- lem - of (genitive)
- lek - immediate genitive 
- lej - name marker
- lef - ending name marker (optional)
Let's go through each of these individually.

#### Len 
Simply add len right after a preposition or before a verb to negate it. 

<details> 
  <summary>Gat len klid</summary>
  I do not eat
</details>

#### Lech
Lech shows the context of the event stated in the sentence. 
<details> 
  <summary>When you draw, I eat</summary>
  Nuz jop lech gat klid. 
</details>

#### Leb
This is exactly the same as lech, but put at the end of a sentence. 
<details> 
  <summary>Gat klid leb nuz jop</summary>
  When you draw, I eat
</details>

#### Lev
This converts verbs/verbs + objects into nouns using the to construction. 
nam = to love
<details> 
  <summary>Gat nam lev klid </summary>
  I love to eat food
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>Gat nam lev jop</summary>
  I love to draw
</details>

#### Leg
This is a relative clause marker. 
<details> 
  <summary>Gat klid  leg dash</summary>
  I eat the food which is good
</details>

#### Lem
This is similar to pi in toki pona. Wikipedia gives a really good explanation of it. 
```
By default, words in noun phrases each affect the sum of all preceding words, modifying the phrase individually in succession. pi regroups this order, introducing a group of words that modifies the phrase as a unit. It is roughly equivalent to hyphenating a phrasal adjective in English. As a common example, "tomo telo nasa" might be interpreted as "weird washroom", whereas "tomo pi telo nasa" might be interpreted as "pub" (literally "strange-liquid building" or "alcohol building"). 
```
word_1 <- adj_1 <- adj_2 <- adj_3 vs word_1 <- adj_1 + lem <- adj_2 <- adj_3  
(((((word_1) <- adj_1)) <- adj_2) <- adj_3) vs (word_1 <- adj_1) <- (adj_2 <- adj_3)  

#### Lek
This is like lem, but it only affects the word directly after it. 

#### Lej
This converts the word directly after lej into a proper noun

#### Lef
This allows names to be an arbituary number of syllables long
Lej ... lef

#### Conjunctions
Sugondese has three conjunctions. They are used in exactly the same way that they are in English. 
- nem - and
- nel - or
- nef - but

#### To exist
Most verbs mean to-be something. Some do not. How do we express the to-be form of these verbs? In Sugondese we use the copula, nuj. 
- noj [modifier] = to be modifier
- noj lem [noun] = to be noun   
Note that in the example above, both the noun and the modifer are conjugated to the modifier form. 
<details> 
  <summary>I am a car. vroom vroom</summary>
  Gat loj lem piaz. vol lum vol lum
</details>

#### To become
The word zuf means to become. It can be used exactly like nuj. 
- zof [modifier] = to become modifier
- zof lem [noun] = to become noun   
tul = stone, rock, hard thing
<details> 
  <summary>I turn to stone. vroom vroom</summary>
  Gat zof lem tual. vol lum vol lum
</details>

#### Causatives
The construction [subject] [verb] jiaf sel [recipient] can be used to show causatives. It says that the subject caused the recipient [verb]. A good example is *Nuz vish jiaf sel gat*. Literaly, *You caused joy to me*, which can be interpreted as *You caused me to be happy*. 
<details> 
  <summary>Gat klid jiaf</summary>
  I cause eating
</details>
<details> 
  <summary>I make you eat</summary>
  Gat klid jiaf sel nuz. 
</details>

### Setting the Scene
Where are the plurals? Where are the tenses? How do you mark aspect? All of these are optional. You mark them with modifiers. 
One thing to note about tenses is that in order to mark a specific time you use a lech clause with the verb guz, meaning time, along with a modifier.
